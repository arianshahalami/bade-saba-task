# Bade Saba Front-end Task

This is role-manager application protected by simple login page

## Tech Stack

-  React
-  Vite
-  Sass

## ⚡️ Features

-  **Vite:** For its fast development, optimized builds, native ES module support, and seamless integration with modern frameworks like React and TypeScript. Its minimal configuration and fast HMR significantly improved our workflow and performance.

-  **XO:** for its powerful linting, ensuring consistent code quality and style. With support for TypeScript, React, and automated formatting, it helps catch issues early and maintain clean, error-free code.

-  **Commit-lint, Lint-staged, prettier and Husky:** to ensure consistent code style and error-free commits. Commit-lint enforces meaningful commit messages, Lint-staged checks code before commits, Prettier formats it, and Husky automates these checks in pre-commit hooks, streamlining our development process.

-  **git flow:** to organize development with separate branches for features, releases, and hotfixes. This ensures a clear workflow, stable production, and smooth releases.
